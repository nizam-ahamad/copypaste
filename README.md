# CopyPaste.me (Standalone Node.js Refactor)

A frictionless sharing application that allows users to securely send text, passwords, and files between devices—refactored to run entirely as a standalone Node.js application.

## 🚀 The Refactor: Why I Modified This Project

This repository is a custom fork and architectural rework of the original [CopyPaste.me](https://github.com/TheSocialCode/CopyPaste.me) project.

The original application relied on a stack that included PHP and MongoDB. As a Computer Science and Engineering student focusing on modern JavaScript ecosystems, I took on the challenge of re-engineering the backend.

**Key Modifications:**

- **Bypassed PHP & MongoDB:** Stripped out the original database and PHP dependencies.
- **Standalone Node.js Environment:** Rewrote the core backend logic to run purely on Node.js, making the application lighter and easier to deploy in JS-centric environments.
- **Streamlined Execution:** Simplified the setup process for local development and testing.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Original UI/UX:** The Social Code Foundation
